### Hello World !.

Hello fellow developers !
This is a toned down simple blog meant to just share information. Since I am a full time student juggling part-time work, self learning, personal projects and life, I have opted to spend less time on the graphical aspects of this blog and more on the information I share.
This blog is going to capture my learning so that fellow developers can learn, point out my mistakes if any so that we all learn from each other. All constructive feedbacks are welcomed. 
Lets learn !
This is my profile on LinkedIn if you need to see who I am [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sehan-pushparaja-97676b61/). Do send me a connection request if you feel I am worthy of being a connection :p
