### Testing : Basics (continued)

There are three types of tests that you may want to do. Extending on the previous example of button clicked, 
assume that it returns the age as well from the database.

Tests you can do could be:
1. Check if the number is added correctly
2. Check if the age is fetched from the db
3. Check if it responds to the button click.

each of these options are a different type of test:
1. Unit test : testing a component in isolation
2. Integration tests : testing if a component works well in combination. Database operations, network oprtations are some examples.
3. Automation tests: automating user behaviour such as mouse clicks, so that you dont have to manually click everytime.
